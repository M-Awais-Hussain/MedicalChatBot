## Features

- **Health Assistance:** Provides general information about symptoms, diseases, and medications.
- **Medical Query Responses:** The chatbot answers user queries based on an indexed medical knowledge base.
- **State-of-the-art AI:** Uses Pinecone for vector search, Groq API for language model processing, and Hugging Face embeddings for semantic understanding.
- **Customizable and Scalable:** Easy to extend for additional models or data sources.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language.
- **Flask:** Web framework for serving the chatbot interface.
- **Langchain:** A framework that simplifies the creation of LLM-based applications.
- **Pinecone:** Vector database for efficient semantic search.
- **Groq API:** Powerful API for running AI models like `llama3-8b-8192`.
- **Hugging Face:** Used for downloading and using pre-trained embeddings for text.
- **Dotenv:** To manage sensitive environment variables.
